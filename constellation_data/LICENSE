Star positions and magnitudes (hipparchos_catalog.tsv) come from the Hipparchos and Tycho Catalogues (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997A%26A...323L..49P)

Constellation line data (constellationship.fab, constellation_names.eng.fab) comes from Stellarium (https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/blob/master/skycultures/western/constellationship.fab) and is available under an MIT license (https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/issues/790).

I have modified constellationship.fab to replace the star 33165 (EZ CMa, mag 6.65) in CMa with the very close and much brighter 33152 (o1 CMa, mag 3.85)
